<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  ### Introduction
  In this era of cut throat competition for job placements, there is a greater than ever need of self assessment for ensuring that the current level of job preparation is upto the general industry standards.
  This led us to create a solution that allows the interviewee to visualize their performance in order to work on their area of weakness and vastly increase their chances of performing well in a job interview amongst others.
  Additionally, interviewers can objectively analyse the performance of the candidates for selection.


  ### Implementation: 
  On the client side, the web pages were implemented using ReactJs as a frontend framework.

  On Server side, NodeJs is used as a runtime environment, with Express as a framework and MongoDb Atlas as a cloud database. 

  Among APIs, we have used Symbl.ai’s Streaming API, Telephony API, Async Video API, Conversation API for speech analytics and Komprehend’s NLP API for other sentence traits (such as: emotions, intent, abusive and sarcastical words) to facilitate our services.

  ### Technology used:
  * Frontend
      * ReactJS
      * CSS
      * JavaScript
      * Material UI
  * Backend
      * NodeJS
      * ExpressJS
  * Database
      * MongoDB
  * APIs
      * Symbl.ai
      * Words API
      * Websockets

  ### Flow Chart:
  ![Flow Chart](https://github.com/ProAbhinav/Vishleshan/blob/master/public/assets/img/FlowChart.jpeg)


  ### Applications:
  Following are the real world applications of our idea.
  As a student or a professional, everyone needs a platform to assess their communication skills. Our platform will provide them a medium to assess themselves and their performance in various circumstances. I.e. pitch meetings, presentations, SWOT analysis presentations . 
  Our platform will help users to assess their performance in mock peer to peer interviews conducted on their mutual interests, which will give them an insight about themselves.
  Our Application can also be used to get a detailed analysis of the applicant/users who are subjected to any type of interview. (Job Interview, Group discussion etc.).


  ### Future Plans: 
  - A leaderboard for the users to give them a competitive feel.
  - Weekly tasks for users to upscale their skills.
  - Providing more features to the users regarding peer interviews. 
  - Detailed analysis and solution to the problems detected during assessment.
  - Scaling the application for a diaspora of users connected with interviews, interrogation and presentations.
  - Peer to peer communication and comparison among friends from friend’s list.
